## 1. Context and Motivation

**Before roles:**
- The chatbot answered questions about the resume in a single way, without considering the user's profile.
- The system was monolithic: a single prompt logic, with no context, tone, or focus customization.
- There was no differentiation between technical, HR, client, or student questions.

**Motivation:**
- Make the chatbot smarter by adapting answers to the user's profile.
- Allow multiple usage contexts (recruiter, developer, client, student).
- Improve user experience and system usefulness.

---

## 2. Objective of the Roles Implementation

- Allow the user to choose an interaction profile (role) and have the chatbot adapt its answers according to this context.
- Modularize the logic of prompts, instructions, and examples for each profile.
- Facilitate future maintenance and expansion (new profiles, behavior adjustments, etc).

---

## 3. Before and After: What Changed?

### Before
- Single, generic prompt for all questions.
- No context differentiation.
- Coupled and inflexible code.

### After
- **Dynamic roles system**: multiple profiles, each with its own focus, tone, examples, and instructions.
- **JSON files** for each role, easily editable and expandable.
- **RoleHandler** centralizing all role logic in the backend.
- **REST endpoints** for querying roles and examples.
- **Frontend** with visual profile selection, animated cards, and persistent context.
- **Automated tests** to ensure integrity.

---

## 4. Architecture Decisions

- **Separation of responsibilities**: backend handles logic and role data, frontend handles user experience.
- **JSON as the source of truth**: each role is a JSON file, making maintenance and versioning easier.
- **RoleHandler**: dedicated class for loading, validating, caching, and generating personalized prompts.
- **RESTful Endpoints**: `/roles`, `/roles/<role_id>/examples`, and `/chat` with role support.
- **Context API in the frontend**: global management of the selected profile.
- **Responsive and accessible design**: consistent experience on any device.

### Example of a role file (`recruiter.json`):
```json
{
  "id": "recruiter",
  "name": "Recruiter/HR",
  "description": "Specialized in recruitment and selection information",
  "icon": "ðŸ‘”",
  "color": "#3B82F6",
  "focus_areas": ["experiencia_profissional", "soft_skills", "projetos_destaque"],
  "tone": "professional",
  "prompt_modifiers": {
    "prefix": "You are talking to a recruiter. Focus on:",
    "emphasis": ["Quantifiable results", "Relevant experience"],
    "avoid": ["Very specific technical details"]
  },
  "example_questions": [
    "What are Lucas's main projects?",
    "How does he work in a team?"
  ]
}
```

## 6. Scripts, Endpoints, and Components

### **Backend**
- **`utils/role_handler.py`**: Central class for roles (loading, validation, prompt generation, examples, cache).
- **`main.py`**:
  - Endpoint `/chat`: now receives the `role` parameter and generates a personalized prompt.
  - Endpoint `/roles`: returns all available roles.
  - Endpoint `/roles/<role_id>/examples`: returns example questions for the role.

### **Frontend**
- **`components/RoleContext.js`**: Global context for role selection and persistence.
- **`components/RoleSelector.js`**: Profile selection screen, animated cards, context integration.
- **`components/RoleCard.js`**: Visual and responsive card for each role, with example tooltips.
- **`chatWindow.js`**: Integrated chat, sends selected role to backend, displays visual context.
- **`index.css`**: Animations, responsiveness, and styles for roles.

---

## 7. Complete Roles Flow (Backend and Frontend)

### **1. Profile Selection (Frontend)**
- User chooses a profile on the selection screen (`RoleSelector`), which updates the global context (`RoleContext`).
- The selected profile is persisted in `localStorage`.

### **2. Sending a Question (Frontend â†’ Backend)**
- When sending a message in the chat, the frontend includes the selected `role.id` in the request to `/chat`.

### **3. Personalized Prompt Generation (Backend)**
- The backend validates the received role.
- The `RoleHandler` loads the role settings and generates a personalized prompt, including prefixes, emphases, and restrictions.
- The prompt is sent to Gemini along with the resume and conversation history.

### **4. Response and Display (Backend â†’ Frontend)**
- The backend returns Gemini's response, already adapted to the profile.
- The frontend displays the answer, highlighting the active profile.
- The user can switch profiles at any time, changing the conversation context.

## 8. Usage Examples and Tests

### **Example Request to `/chat`**
```json
{
  "question": "What are the main projects?",
  "history": [...],
  "role": "recruiter"
}
```

### **Example Response**
```json
{
  "answer": "Lucas worked on projects such as...",
  "role": "recruiter"
}
```

### **RoleHandler (backend/utils/role_handler.py)**
```python
class RoleHandler:
    def __init__(self, roles_dir: str = None):
        ...
    def load_roles(self) -> Dict:
        ...
    def generate_role_prompt(self, role_id: str, base_prompt: str) -> str:
        ...
    def validate_role(self, role_id: str) -> bool:
        ...

        ...
```

### **Endpoint /chat (backend/main.py)**
```python
@app.route("/chat", methods=["POST"])
def chat():

    if not role_handler.validate_role(role):
        role = "recruiter"
